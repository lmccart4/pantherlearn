We chose **m × v** as our best candidate for the \"conserved quantity of motion.\" We previously disproved **m × s** when two carts collided and stopped — m × s was destroyed while m × v was not. Now we design an experiment where we **predict** the result using conservation of momentum, then **measure** to see if reality matches.",
