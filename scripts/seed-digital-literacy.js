A corner of the room or a closet works great.\n\n**2. Speak clearly at a steady pace** — Don't rush. Talk like you're explaining something to a friend.\n\n**3. Record in sections** — Don't try to record the whole thing in one take. Break it into chunks: hook, context, examples, takeaway.\n\n**4. Do 2–3 takes** — Your second or third take is almost always better than your first.\n\n**5. Use headphones to monitor** — Plug in headphones so you can hear what the recording actually sounds like."
